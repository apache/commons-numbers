/** This interface represents a region of a space as a partition.

 * &lt;p&gt;Region are subsets of a space, they can be infinite (whole
 * space, half space, infinite stripe ...) or finite (polygons in 2D,
 * polyhedrons in 3D ...). Their main characteristic is to separate
 * points that are considered to be &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the region from
 * points considered to be &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of it. In between, there
 * may be points on the &lt;em&gt;boundary&lt;/em&gt; of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

 * &lt;p&gt;This implementation is limited to regions for which the boundary
 * is composed of several {@link SubHyperplane sub-hyperplanes},
 * including regions with no boundary at all: the whole space and the
 * empty region. They are not necessarily finite and not necessarily
 * path-connected. They can contain holes.&lt;/p&gt;

 * &lt;p&gt;Regions can be combined using the traditional sets operations :
 * union, intersection, difference and symetric difference (exclusive
 * or) for the binary operations, complement for the unary
 * operation.&lt;/p&gt;

 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that this interface is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; intended to be implemented
 * by Apache Commons Math users, it is only intended to be implemented
 * within the library itself. New methods may be added even for minor
 * versions, which breaks compatibility for external implementations.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
