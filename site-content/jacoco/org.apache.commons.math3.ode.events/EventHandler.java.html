/** This interface represents a handler for discrete events triggered
 * during ODE integration.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Some events can be triggered at discrete times as an ODE problem
 * is solved. This occurs for example when the integration process
 * should be stopped as some state is reached (G-stop facility) when the
 * precise date is unknown a priori, or when the derivatives have
 * discontinuities, or simply when the user wants to monitor some
 * states boundaries crossings.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;These events are defined as occurring when a &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;
 * switching function sign changes.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Since events are only problem-dependent and are triggered by the
 * independent &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; variable and the state vector, they can
 * occur at virtually any time, unknown in advance. The integrators will
 * take care to avoid sign changes inside the steps, they will reduce
 * the step size when such an event is detected in order to put this
 * event exactly at the end of the current step. This guarantees that
 * step interpolation (which always has a one step scope) is relevant
 * even in presence of discontinuities. This is independent from the
 * stepsize control provided by integrators that monitor the local
 * error (this event handling feature is available for all integrators,
 * including fixed step ones).&lt;/p&gt;

   * &lt;p&gt;The discrete events are generated when the sign of this
   * switching function changes. The integrator will take care to change
   * the stepsize in such a way these events occur exactly at step boundaries.
   * The switching function must be continuous in its roots neighborhood
   * (but not necessarily smooth), as the integrator will need to find its
   * roots to locate precisely the events.&lt;/p&gt;
   * &lt;p&gt;Also note that the integrator expect that once an event has occurred,
   * the sign of the switching function at the start of the next step (i.e.
   * just after the event) is the opposite of the sign just before the event.
   * This consistency between the steps &lt;string&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be preserved,
   * otherwise {@link org.apache.commons.math3.exception.NoBracketingException
   * exceptions} related to root not being bracketed will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
   * &lt;p&gt;This need for consistency is sometimes tricky to achieve. A typical
   * example is using an event to model a ball bouncing on the floor. The first
   * idea to represent this would be to have {@code g(t) = h(t)} where h is the
   * height above the floor at time {@code t}. When {@code g(t)} reaches 0, the
   * ball is on the floor, so it should bounce and the typical way to do this is
   * to reverse its vertical velocity. However, this would mean that before the
   * event {@code g(t)} was decreasing from positive values to 0, and after the
   * event {@code g(t)} would be increasing from 0 to positive values again.
   * Consistency is broken here! The solution here is to have {@code g(t) = sign
   * * h(t)}, where sign is a variable with initial value set to {@code +1}. Each
   * time {@link #eventOccurred(double, double[], boolean) eventOccurred} is called,
   * {@code sign} is reset to {@code -sign}. This allows the {@code g(t)}
   * function to remain continuous (and even smooth) even across events, despite
   * {@code h(t)} is not. Basically, the event is used to &lt;em&gt;fold&lt;/em&gt; {@code h(t)}
   * at bounce points, and {@code sign} is used to &lt;em&gt;unfold&lt;/em&gt; it back, so the
   * solvers sees a {@code g(t)} function which behaves smoothly even across events.&lt;/p&gt;

   * @param t current value of the independent &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; variable

   * @return value of the g switching function

  /** Handle an event and choose what to do next.

   * &lt;p&gt;This method is called when the integrator has accepted a step
   * ending exactly on a sign change of the function, just &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;
   * the step handler itself is called (see below for scheduling). It
   * allows the user to update his internal data to acknowledge the fact
   * the event has been handled (for example setting a flag in the {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math3.ode.FirstOrderDifferentialEquations
   * differential equations} to switch the derivatives computation in
   * case of discontinuity), or to direct the integrator to either stop
   * or continue integration, possibly with a reset state or derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

   * &lt;ul&gt;
   *   &lt;li&gt;if {@link Action#STOP} is returned, the step handler will be called
   *   with the &lt;code&gt;isLast&lt;/code&gt; flag of the {@link
   *   org.apache.commons.math3.ode.sampling.StepHandler#handleStep handleStep}
   *   method set to true and the integration will be stopped,&lt;/li&gt;
   *   &lt;li&gt;if {@link Action#RESET_STATE} is returned, the {@link #resetState
   *   resetState} method will be called once the step handler has
   *   finished its task, and the integrator will also recompute the
   *   derivatives,&lt;/li&gt;
   *   &lt;li&gt;if {@link Action#RESET_DERIVATIVES} is returned, the integrator
   *   will recompute the derivatives,
   *   &lt;li&gt;if {@link Action#CONTINUE} is returned, no specific action will
   *   be taken (apart from having called this method) and integration
   *   will continue.&lt;/li&gt;
   * &lt;/ul&gt;

   * &lt;p&gt;The scheduling between this method and the {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math3.ode.sampling.StepHandler StepHandler} method {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math3.ode.sampling.StepHandler#handleStep(
   * org.apache.commons.math3.ode.sampling.StepInterpolator, boolean)
   * handleStep(interpolator, isLast)} is to call this method first and
   * &lt;code&gt;handleStep&lt;/code&gt; afterwards. This scheduling allows the integrator to
   * pass &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;code&gt;isLast&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the step
   * handler to make it aware the step will be the last one if this method
   * returns {@link Action#STOP}. As the interpolator may be used to navigate back
   * throughout the last step (as {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math3.ode.sampling.StepNormalizer StepNormalizer}
   * does for example), user code called by this method and user
   * code called by step handlers may experience apparently out of order values
   * of the independent time variable. As an example, if the same user object
   * implements both this {@link EventHandler EventHandler} interface and the
   * {@link org.apache.commons.math3.ode.sampling.FixedStepHandler FixedStepHandler}
   * interface, a &lt;em&gt;forward&lt;/em&gt; integration may call its
   * &lt;code&gt;eventOccurred&lt;/code&gt; method with t = 10 first and call its
   * &lt;code&gt;handleStep&lt;/code&gt; method with t = 9 afterwards. Such out of order
   * calls are limited to the size of the integration step for {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math3.ode.sampling.StepHandler variable step handlers} and
   * to the size of the fixed step for {@link
   * org.apache.commons.math3.ode.sampling.FixedStepHandler fixed step handlers}.&lt;/p&gt;

   * @param t current value of the independent &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; variable
   * @param y array containing the current value of the state vector
   * @param increasing if true, the value of the switching function increases
   * when times increases around event (note that increase is measured with respect
   * to physical time, not with respect to integration which may go backward in time)
   * @return indication of what the integrator should do next, this
   * value must be one of {@link Action#STOP}, {@link Action#RESET_STATE},
   * {@link Action#RESET_DERIVATIVES} or {@link Action#CONTINUE}
   */
  Action eventOccurred(double t, double[] y, boolean increasing);

  /** Reset the state prior to continue the integration.

   * &lt;p&gt;This method is called after the step handler has returned and
   * before the next step is started, but only when {@link
   * #eventOccurred} has itself returned the {@link Action#RESET_STATE}
   * indicator. It allows the user to reset the state vector for the
