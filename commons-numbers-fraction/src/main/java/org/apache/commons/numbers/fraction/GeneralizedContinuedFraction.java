/**
 * Provides a means to evaluate
 * <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeneralizedContinuedFraction.html">generalized continued fractions</a>.
 *
 * <p>The continued fraction uses the following form for the numerator ({@code a}) and
 * denominator ({@code b}) coefficients:
 * <pre>
 *              a1
 * b0 + ------------------
 *      b1 +      a2
 *           -------------

 *                --------
 *                b3 + ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A generator of the coefficients must be provided to evaluate the continued fraction.
 *
 * <p>The implementation of the fraction evaluation is based on the modified Lentz algorithm
 * as described on page 508 in:
