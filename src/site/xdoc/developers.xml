      <p>
        Maintenance of a library by decentralized team requires communication.
        It is important that developers follow guidelines laid down by the community
        to ensure that the code they create can be successfully maintained by others.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name='Guidelines'>
      <p>
        Developers are asked to comply with the following development guidelines.
        Code that does not comply with the guidelines including the word <i>must</i>
        will not be committed.  Our aim will be to fix all of the exceptions to the
        "<i>should</i>" guidelines prior to a release.

      <subsection name="Contributing">
        <p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Download the Commons Numbers source code.  Follow the instructions
            under the heading "Repository Checkout" on the
            <a href="https://gitbox.apache.org/">Git at the ASF page</a>.
            The git url for the current development sources of Commons Numbers
            is <source>http://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/commons-numbers.git</source>
            for anonymous read-only access and
            <source>https://apacheid@gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/commons-numbers.git</source>
            (where apacheid should be replaced by each committer Apache ID) for committers
            read-write access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Like most commons components, Commons Numbers uses Apache Maven as our
            build tool.
            To build Commons Numbers using Maven, you can follow the instructions for
            <a href="https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html">Building a
            project with Maven</a>.
            Launch Maven from the top-level directory
            in the checkout of Commons Numbers trunk. No special setup is required,
            except that currently to build the site (i.e. to execute Maven's
            "site" goal), you may need to increase the default memory allocation
            (e.g. <code>export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m</code>) before launching
            Maven.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be sure to join the commons-dev and commons-user
            <a href="mail-lists.html">
              email lists</a> and use them appropriately (make sure the string
              "[Numbers]" starts the Subject line of all your postings).
              Make any proposals here where the group can comment on them.

            Generating patches: The requested format for generating patches is
            the Unified Diff format, which can be easily generated using the git
            client or various IDEs.
            <source>git diff -p > patch </source>
            Run this command from the top-level project directory (where pom.xml
            resides).

        <p><strong>Contributing ideas and code</strong></p>
        <p>
          Follow the steps below when making suggestions for additions or
          enhancements to Commons Numbers. This will make it easier for the community
          to comment on your ideas and for the committers to keep track of them.
          Thanks in advance!
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start with a post to the commons-dev mailing list, with [Numbers] at
          the beginning of the subject line, followed by a short title
          describing the new feature or enhancement;  for example, "[Numbers]
          New continued fraction algorithm".
          The body of the post should include each of the following items
          (but be <strong>as brief as possible</strong>):
          <ul>
            <li>A concise description of the new feature / enhancement</li>
            <li>References to definitions and algorithms. Using standard
            definitions and algorithms makes communication much easier and will
            greatly increase the chances that we will accept the code / idea</li>
            <li>Some indication of why the addition / enhancement is practically
            useful</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Assuming a generally favorable response to the idea on commons-dev,
          the next step is to file a report on the issue-tracking system (JIRA).
          Create a JIRA ticket using the the feature title as the short
          description. Incorporate feedback from the initial posting in the
          description. Add a reference to the discussion thread.
          </li>
          <li>Submit code as:
          <ul>
            <li>Attachments to the JIRA ticket.  Please use one
            ticket for each feature, adding multiple patches to the ticket
            as necessary.  Use the git diff command to generate your patches as
            diffs.  Please do not submit modified copies of existing java files.
            </li>
            <li>A pull request (PR) via GitHub.
            To link the PR to a corresponding JIRA ticket prefix the PR title with
            <code>NUMBERS-xxx:</code> where <code>xxx</code> is the issue number.<br/>
            Please include quality commit messages with a single line title of about 50
            characters, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation
            of the changeset. The title should be prefixed with the JIRA ticket number if
            applicable, e.g. <code>NUMBERS-xxx: New continued fraction algorithm</code>.
            See <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project">
            contributing to a project</a> in the git book for guidelines on commit messages.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Be patient (but not <strong>too</strong> patient) with  committers reviewing
          patches/PRs. Post a *nudge* message to commons-dev with a reference to the
          ticket if a submission goes more than a few days with no comment or commit.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <subsection name='Coding Style'>
        <p>
          Commons Numbers follows <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html">
          Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language (circa 1999)</a>. As part of the maven
          build process, style checking is performed using the Checkstyle plugin,
          using the properties specified in <code>checkstyle.xml</code>. This is based on
          the default <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/sun_checks.xml">
          sun checks</a> defined by the Checkstyle plugin using current Java best practices.
          Committed code <i>should</i> generate no Checkstyle errors.  One thing
          that Checkstyle will complain about is tabs included in the source code.
          Please make sure to set your IDE or editor to use spaces instead of tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Committers should configure the <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code>
          git repository or global settings with <code>git config</code>.
          These settings define the identity and mail of the committer. See <a
          href="https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration">Customizing
          Git - Git Configuration</a> in the git book for an explanation about how to
          configure these settings and more.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name='Documentation'>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Committed code <i>must</i> include full javadoc.
          </li>
          <li>
            All component contracts <i>must</i> be fully specified in the javadoc class,
            interface or method comments, including specification of acceptable ranges
            of values, exceptions or special return values.
          </li>
          <li>
            External references or full statements of definitions for all the
            terms used in component documentation <i>must</i> be provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commons Numbers javadoc generation supports embedded LaTeX formulas via the
            <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> javascript display engine.
            To embed mathematical expressions formatted in LaTeX in javadoc, simply surround
            the expression to be formatted with either <code>\(</code> and <code>\)</code>
            for inline formulas (or <code>\[</code> and <code>\]</code> to have the formula
            appear on a separate line).
            For example,
            <code>\(</code><code>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</code><code>\)</code>
            will render an in-line formula
            saying that (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triplet: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
            <br/>
            See the MathJax and LaTex documentation for details on how to represent formulas
            and escape special characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implementations <i>should</i> use standard algorithms and
            references or full descriptions of all algorithms <i>should</i> be
            provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additions and enhancements <i>should</i> include updates to the User
            Guide.

            All public methods advertise all exceptions that they can generate.
            Exceptions <i>must</i> be documented in Javadoc and the documentation
            <i>must</i> include full description of the conditions under which
            exceptions are thrown.

          <li>
            Unit tests <i>should</i> provide full path coverage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unit tests <i>should</i> verify all boundary conditions specified in
            interface contracts, including verification that exceptions are thrown or
            special values (e.g. Double.NaN, Double.Infinity) are returned as
            expected.
