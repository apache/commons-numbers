This document is meant as a step-by-step recipe to achieve the release of
the Commons Numbers component. Note that more general instructions valid
for all components, including [numbers], are available on the Apache Commons
main site: at "https://commons.apache.org/releases/prepare.html" and
"https://commons.apache.org/releases/release.html".

When performing a release it is recommended to make notes of any changes that
were required to those detailed in this document. The changes can be incorporated
after a successful release.

The files "settings-security.xml" and "settings.xml" are minimal examples
of files used by maven to pick up authentication credentials needed to
connect to remote servers and to cryptographically sign the artifacts.

Release preparation is done on the release manager local host in a branch.
As branches deletion is now forbidden at Apache, we will use a specific
release branch for every version.
The branch will be simply named X.Y-release, with X.Y being the version number.
The branch will be used to store the release specific parts (i.e. the pom changes with
the version number, the release date in the site and so on). Everything else and in
particular code change that will remain in the component after the release must be
committed to the master branch (or version branch). The release candidate branch will
be created from master or version branch at the start of each new candidate for
this particular release. Once the release is done, the branch will be merged back to
master, but it will never be deleted so release history will be preserved.

The example below show a typical workflow. Just after commit A in the master branch, the
X.Y-release branch is created starting from master. This is shown by the 'b' in the
second line. Then release specific commits are made on the pom and a few other
files, leading to a commit which will be tagged as RC1. This release candidate fails, and
a few corrections need to be made on master, corresponding to commits B and C. Then the
X.Y-release branch is synchronized by running a 'git merge' command on the branch.
This is shown by the 'm' in the second line. A new commit is tagged as RC2. This second
release candidate also fails, and a new correction is made on master branch, a new merge
is done on the X.Y-release branch, a new commit is tagged and a third release candidate is
create, which succeeds. Then a final tag will be added on the final commit of this branch
showing the status as released. Then the files are cleaned to prepare for next version
(pom getting again a SNAPSHOT suffix, changes.xml getting a new placeholder for changes)
and the cleaned branch is merged back to master. Once the X.Y-release branch has been merged,
it is kept for history. The release for next version will use another specific branch.


 ----A-------> B --> C----------> D--------------------------------------m---->    <- master branch
      \               \            \                                    /
       b---> RC1 ------m---> RC2 ---m---> RC3/final release --> cleaning --X       <- X.Y-release branch

This process allows:

 - to never commit release candidate specific changes to the master
   branch (so the pom on master always holds a SNAPSHOT version),
 - to preserve future reference to the release
 - to allow parallel work on master during the release
 - if necessary to have multiple release managers or help on the
   release as the X.Y-release branch is shared


(0)
Preliminary checks:
 * All Java files must contain a license header. The "RAT" maven plugin will
   generate a report indicating for which files the license is missing.
 * For a "minor" release, the library must be backward-compatible.
   Ensure the binary compatibility release version is correctly set in the pom.xml using the
   appropriate properties:
     <properties>
       <!-- ... -->
       <commons.release.version>1.0</commons.release.version>
       <commons.bc.version>1.0</commons.bc.version>
       <!-- ... -->
     </properties>
   Check all the issues reported by the "Clirr" and "japicmp" plugin.
 * Clear all "CheckStyle" warnings.
 * Make sure that the construct reported by "SpotBugs" and "PMD" are intentional.
 * Mark all issues fixed in the release as resolved in the bug-tracking system (JIRA). Issues marked
   as 'Implemented' or 'Fixed' will appear in the changes report. Add a corresponding entry in
   "src/changes/changes.xml" for the JIRA ticket.


(1)
As an optional step, you can test that everything works locally, i.e.
that the build process can create all the necessary artifacts.

  (1a)
  The command

    $ JAVA_HOME="__Path_to_a_JDK__" mvn -Duser.name="__Your_Apache_id__" -Dcommons.release.dryRun=true -Ptest-deploy -Prelease clean test package site deploy

  should create the artifacts in the "target/deploy" directory.

  At some point when processing the above command, the GPG passphrase will be
  requested; to avoid problems, the "gpg2" executable should be specified in
  the "settings.xml" file (see below).
  Note: If running from a remote terminal, you might need to tune the "gpg-agent"
  configuration file
    ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
  to contain the following statements:
    ---CUT---
    enable-ssh-support
    pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-tty
    ---CUT---
  and execute
    $ export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
  in order to set up the environment for entering the passphrase.

  (1b)
  When the above works, you can test the creation of the full distribution
  files with the following commands:

    $ ( cd dist-archive && mvn assembly:single )

  The "dist-archive/target" directory will then contain those files:
    commons-numbers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz
    commons-numbers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip
    commons-numbers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-src.tar.gz
    commons-numbers-1.0-SNAPSHOT-src.zip


(2)
At this point, you will work mainly on the X.Y-release branch.

If the X.Y-release branch does not exist because it is the first release
candidate, create it locally starting from the master branch or the version
branch and push it to Apache repository (assuming it is called origin),
remembering the binding between the local and remote origin branches:

  $ git branch 1.0-release
  $ git push -u origin 1.0-release

(Optional)
Modify the dist-archive/pom.xml to update the release manager name and GPG signing key
to be used for the release.


(3)
Switch to the release branch:

  $ git checkout 1.0-release


(4)
If there have been changes committed in the master branch or the version
branch since the creation of the release branch, there are two cases:

  (4a)
  if all these changes must be included in version 1.0, merge "master"
  or the version branch into "1.0-release":

    $ git merge master

  or, if the version branch is called "1.x-release"

    $ git merge 1.x-release

  (4b)
  if only part of these changes must be included in version 1.0,
  cherry-pick the required commits into the "1.0-release" branch:

    $ git cherry-pick commit-SHA


(5)
Update the release specific files, checking you are really working on the
release branch and *not* on the master branch.

In particular:
 * Update and commit the "src/site/site.xml" file in each maven module to contain
   the information about the API docs of the new release.
 * Estimate a release date (taking into account the release vote delay) and
   insert it in the "src/changes/changes.xml" file.
 * Update the "pom.xml" to contain the final version number and not a SNAPSHOT:
   Assuming that the release version will be "1.0", modify the "<version>" tag to
   read:

    <version>1.0</version>

   This can be done using maven:

    $ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0 -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -Pcommons-numbers-examples

   You will need to update the version in dist-archive/pom.xml manually.

   Modify the section of "<properties>" that also refers to version numbers.
   You should uncomment the "<commons.rc.version>" line and indicate the
   appropriate numbering of the release candidate: This refers to how many
   times you will need to repeat this whole release process until it is
   accepted (by a vote):

  <properties>
    <!-- ... -->
    <commons.release.version>1.0</commons.release.version>
    <commons.rc.version>RC1</commons.rc.version>
    <!-- ... -->
  </properties>


(6)
The "download" page template is located at "src/site/xdoc/download_numbers.xml".
This file is updated automatically by running the command:

  $ mvn -N -Pcommons-numbers-examples commons-build:download-page


(7)
The "release notes" file will be created by gathering all the changes
collected during development in the file "src/changes/changes.xml".

Create it by running:

  $ mvn -Prelease-notes -Pcommons-numbers-examples changes:announcement-generate

Ensure the formatting of the RELEASE-NOTES.txt is consistent. Compare the main
header description to the previous release notes in src/site/resources/release-notes/
and update the line wrap formatting to match. Remove trailing whitespace.
Ensure the lines wrap at 100 characters.
Note that wrapping is taken from changes.xml which should be written to wrap
at 100 characters but allowing for a indent on the first line due to the Numbers
issue field. Update changes.xml if appropriate.

Append the previous release notes from src/site/resources/release-notes/ to the current one:

  $ (echo "=============================================================================" &&
     cat src/site/resources/release-notes/RELEASE-NOTES-<old version>.txt) >> RELEASE-NOTES.txt

Copy the RELEASE-NOTES.txt to src/site/resources/release-notes:

  $ cp RELEASE-NOTES.txt src/site/resources/release-notes/RELEASE-NOTES-<version>.txt

Update the src/site/xdoc/release-history.xml to include the latest version. This generates
the release history page on the web site.

Commit the updated files to git:

  $ git add .

Check the modified files:

  $ git status

Commit the changes:

  $ git commit -m "Release candidate."


(8)
Create a GPG signed tag that will contain the whole source of this release candidate.
First, make sure once again that the workspace is up-to-date:

  $ git status

Then, assuming the first candidate, the suffix will be "RC1" (this should
be the same as in the "<properties>" in the "pom.xml"), and the command
will be:

  $ git tag -u "__Your_key_id__" -s -m "RC1" commons-numbers-1.0-rc1

If you have several GPG keys, you may prefer to use "-u keyId" to select a specific
key for signing the tag instead of "-s" which select automatically one key
from the configured e-mail address.

Check the tag GPG signature:

  $ git tag -v commons-numbers-1.0-rc1

You will get something like:

  object cf4a9d70c9ac24dd7196995390171150e4e56451
  type commit
  tag commons-numbers-1.0-rc1
  tagger YourName <YourApacheEmail> 1418934614 +0100

  RC1

followed by GPG output lines.

Remember the commit ID listed in the object line (here cf4a9d70c9ac24dd7196995390171150e4e56451),
as it is the most stable reference for traceability.

Push everything (including the tag!) on the Apache repository:

  $ git push --tags


(9)
Switch to a new directory out of your regular workspace, and retrieve
the official tag from the Apache repository:

  $ cd /tmp
  $ git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/commons-numbers.git --branch commons-numbers-1.0-rc1

In the command above, the --branch option accepts both branch names and tags names,
so we specify directly the tag here. Git will warn that the resulting workspace
is in 'detached HEAD' state and 'git status' commands will warn that you are not
currently on any branch. This is expected in this situation.

Check that the last commit has the id you noted in the previous step:

  $ cd commons-numbers
  $ git log -1


(10)
If this is your first release, you might need to add your GPG encryption
key to the KEYS file. [If you have already done so, skip this section.]

Retrieve the files from the SVN repository:

  $ svn co --depth=files \
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/commons/svn

and follow the instructions at the top of the "KEYS" file.


(11)
Create and transfer the artifacts to the Nexus server (a.k.a. "deploy").

Because the artifacts must be cryptographically signed, this step requires that
a profile named "release" exists in the maven "settings.xml" configuration file
which will contain the identifier of your GPG key (cf. sample "settings.xml"
file). You will also have to follow the instructions at
https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html to set your password
for your apache id in the settings.xml file which is used for Nexus repository staging.

The release process requires commit access for the commons SVN repository used to host the
web site. This will use the provided 'user.name' for SVN. If your SVN is not set-up to
cache passwords then a password must be provided. This can be done using a <server> section in
the maven settings.xml file. Typically the username is the same for Nexus repository staging
(i.e. your apache id) so the server 'apache.releases.https' configured in the example
settings.xml file can be used by setting the commons.distServer property for the commons release
plugin (see https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-release-plugin/index.html).

You can then run

  With site generation:

  $ mvn -Duser.name="__Your_Apache_id__" [-Dcommons.distServer=apache.releases.https] \
        -Pcommons-numbers-examples -Prelease clean package site site:stage deploy

  Or without the site generation:

  $ mvn -Duser.name="__Your_Apache_id__" [-Dcommons.distServer=apache.releases.https] \
        -Pcommons-numbers-examples -Prelease clean deploy

  The site can be generated afterwards using 'mvn -Pcommons-numbers-examples package site site stage'.

which will transfer the artifacts to the Nexus repository located at
  https://repository.apache.org/index.html#stagingRepositories

This process transfers more files than really needed in the the "staging" (i.e.
non official) maven repository. The files expected in the repository are
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.0.pom
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.0.jar
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.0.javadoc
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.0.sources
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.0.test-sources
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.0.tests
and their associated fingerprints
  <file-name>.md5
  <file-name>.sha1
and their signatures
  <file-name>.asc

Nexus used to add "md5" and "sha1" checksums files to the "asc" files
(cryptographic signature). If these fingerprints on signatures are
present, they must be manually removed from Nexus staging area.

The process used to transfer the complete source and binaries distributions files,
(for each module):
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactId>-1.0-bin.tar.gz
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactId>-1.0-bin.zip
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactId>-1.0-src.tar.gz
  commons-numbers-<ModuleArtifactId>-1.0-src.zip
as well as their associated .md5 and .sha1 fingerprints and .asc signatures.
All these files are not maven artifacts but rather distribution archives: They
belong elsewhere; hence they must also been removed from the Nexus staging
repository.

As a measure of sanity check, the Nexus repository must be manually "closed"
before other people review the deliverables just created.
How to "close" the staging repository is explained at this page:
  http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#close-stage


(12)
Create and upload the other distribution files to the "dev" distribution
area on the Apache servers.

  (12a)
  The module "dist-archive" is dedicated to creating the archive files.
  Run the following command:

    $ ( cd dist-archive && mvn -P release assembly:single )

  (12b)
  Go to a temporary directory and check out the "dev" area.

    $ cd /tmp
    $ svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/numbers
    $ cd numbers

  (12c)
  Create a new folder for the release candidate artifacts.

    $ svn mkdir 1.0-RC1

  (12d)
  Copy the README.html and HEADER.html files from the last released version and add to the new directory.

    $ curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/commons/numbers/README.html > 1.0-RC1/README.html
    $ curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/commons/numbers/HEADER.html > 1.0-RC1/HEADER.html

  (12e)
  Edit the "README.html" file to contain the released version number.

  (12f)
  Copy other files from the RC workspace:

    $ cp path-to-the-RC-workspace/RELEASE-NOTES.txt .
    $ cp path-to-the-RC-workspace/CONTRIBUTING.md .
    $ cp path-to-the-RC-workspace/dist-archive/target/*-bin.* binaries
    $ cp path-to-the-RC-workspace/dist-archive/target/*-src.* source

  (12g)
  Create copies of the HEADER.html and README.html files in the subdirectories
    $ cp README.html binaries
    $ cp HEADER.html binaries
    $ cp README.html source
    $ cp HEADER.html source

  Currently, the commons-parent build does not create the
   * signatures (".asc"),
   * hashes (".sha512")
  of the distribution files.  Hence, you have to create them "manually"!
  For the signature, the command is
    $ gpg -ab file-to-sign
  For the hash, the commands is
    $ sha512sum -b input-file > input-file.sha512

  Double-check the signatures and hashes with the following:
    $ gpg --verify asc-file
    $ sha512sum -c hash-file

  (12h)
  Commit to SVN:

    $ svn add \
      CONTRIBUTING.md \
      README.html \
      RELEASE-NOTES.txt \
      binaries/* \
      source/*
    $ svn commit -m "Distribution files for Commons Numbers v1.0 (RC1)."


(13)
As the web site staging area is shared among all commons components and therefore
could be published before the vote ends, it is not recommended to use the standard
staging area for the release candidate. So you will just archive the site and
transfer it to your apache personal area for review.
Here is how to do this using "lftp" to initiate the sftp transfer. "lftp" supports
a mirror command for recursive transfers; don't forget the -R flag for uploading
instead of downloading the site.
If you haven't setup your login on home.apache.org you will need to go to
  https://id.apache.org/
login and copy the contents of your
  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
file to "SSH Key (authorized_keys line)".
Then run these commands:

  (Optional. Use this if the release step in (11) was performed without site generation.
  Do not run 'clean' as it will delete the release source/binary artifacts and the release
  plugin cannot be used to generate the template VOTE.txt file with the correct hashes.)
  $ mvn -Pcommons-numbers-examples package site site:stage

  $ cd target
  $ mv staging commons-numbers-1.0-RC1-site
  $ lftp sftp://__Your_apache_login__@home.apache.org
     lftp you@home.apache.org:~> mkdir public_html
     lftp you@home.apache.org:~> cd public_html
     lftp you@home.apache.org:~/public_html> mirror -R commons-numbers-1.0-RC1-site
     lftp you@home.apache.org:~/public_html> bye


(14)
[NOTE: The "Commons release-plugin" can generate the text for the "[VOTE]"
message. However, the script makes some (incorrect) assumptions and produces
a result that must be heavily edited.]

Template the vote using this command (run from the dist-archive module):

  $ mvn org.apache.commons:commons-release-plugin:vote-txt -Dcommons.nexus.repo.id=1476

See target/VOTE.txt. This must be heavily edited. It is useful to generate the release hashes.

Call to vote by sending a message to the "dev" ML with subject
"[VOTE] Release Commons Numbers 1.0 based on RC1". You can use the following example as
a reference point, replacing the URLs with the appropriate ones:
----------
We have fixed quite a few bugs and added some significant enhancements since Apache Commons Numbers 1.0-beta1 was released,
so I would like to release Apache Commons Numbers 1.0.

Apache Commons Numbers (full distribution) 1.0 RC1 is available for review here:
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/numbers/1.0-RC1 (svn revision 48777)

The Git tag commons-numbers-1.0-rc1 commit for this RC is 89a9c3817222a6c67d7a231b19f6c5c7fc995208 which you can browse here:
    https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=commons-numbers.git;a=commit;h=89a9c3817222a6c67d7a231b19f6c5c7fc995208
You may checkout this tag using:
    git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/commons-numbers.git --branch commons-numbers-1.0-rc1 commons-numbers-1.0-rc1

Maven artifacts are here:

If some blocking problems have been found in the release deliverables, cancel
the vote by sending a "[CANCEL][VOTE]" message to the "dev" ML.
After correcting the problems, you'll likely have to start again from step 3,
4 or 5.


(16)
After at least 72 hours have elapsed, send a "[VOTE][RESULT]" mail to
summarize the outcome of the vote. This should tally the votes cast,
and state which are binding (PMC members). The vote needs at least three +1's
from PMC members to pass.


(17)
The distribution files must be moved from the development area to the release
area of the Apache dist server.

  (17a)
  Checkout the official distribution repository:

    $ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/commons/numbers

  Identify symbolic links:

    $ find . -type l

  (17b)
  Copy the files from the checkout of the repository that was voted on:

    $ cd numbers
    $ rsync -Cavz path-to-RC-dev/numbers/ .

  [Note: This might overwrite symbolic links; in this case, do a "svn
  revert" in order to restore the files that should not be updated.]

  (17c)
  Check files. The following is useful:

    $ svn diff --summarize

  Perform a "svn add" for the new release artefacts.
  Perform a "svn del" for the old release(s) artefacts.

  (17d)
  Commit:

    $ svn commit -m "Release Commons Numbers v1.0 (from RC1)."

  (17e)
  Register the release at
    https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?commons


(18)
Login to the Nexus repository located at
  https://repository.apache.org/index.html#stagingRepositories

Release (a.k.a. "promote") the artifacts on the Nexus server, as shown here:
  http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#promote


(19)
Publish the web site. This is done by first committing the web site to the
staging area, and then by publishing the staging area (which is shared among
all commons components).

In order to commit the web site to the staging area, look at the subversion
workspace that was automatically checked out during the 'mvn site' command in
folder site-content. Note that svn commits in the site-content directory are
immediately synced with the live site and so your changes should show up in a
few minutes once you commit the new site. You can also check out the site
directly by yourself elsewhere:

  $ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/commons/content/proper/commons-numbers site-content

Remove all files there (except .svn folder) and move all the files from the site.

 $ cd site-content
 $ rm -rf *
 $ cp -pR ../target/commons-numbers-1.0-RC1-site/* .

Check for new or deleted files:
 $ svn status
and "svn add" or "svn del" them if necessary.

It is very useful to know changes to the project since the last release. The clirr and japicmp
reports are helpful for the public API. Changes in commons-numbers-examples are not subject to these
reports and require developer insight. If in doubt do not delete files.

The following commands are useful:

Reverting:

  $ svn status | grep ^M
  $ svn status | awk '{if ($1 == "M") print $2 }' | xargs svn revert

Deleting (**do not** delete old javadocs):

  $ svn status | grep -v javadocs | grep ^!
  $ svn status | grep -v javadocs | awk '{if ($1 == "!") print $2 }' | xargs svn del

Adding:

  $ svn status | grep ^?
  $ svn status | awk '{if ($1 == "?") print $2 }' | xargs svn add

Commit the new contents of the web site:
  $ svn commit -m "Commons Numbers v1.0 was released (from RC1). Web site update"

Note the SVN website revision for the next step.


Edit the file component_releases.properties to hold the current version and release date for
your component:

  $ svn checkout --depth files https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/cms-site/trunk/conf/component_releases.properties

  [edit file]

  $ (cd conf && svn commit -m "Commons NUMBERS v1.0 was released (from RC1)")


(20)
The Javadoc for several versions is kept available on the website, under the
"javadocs" directory.
There is a huge number of files that never change, so they are not retrieved by
default in the working copy when running 'svn checkout'.
The Javadoc must therefore be copied manually using server side copy from the
"apidocs" directory after release, in order for the links to former versions
to work. This is done using the "doc/release/copyLongTermJavadoc.sh" script
(options are the svn revision and the component's new version).

Wait a few minutes for the live site to fully sync and then check
  https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-numbers/
to make sure that everything looks correct.


(21)
Put the official final tag to point at the same commit as the last release candidate tag:

  $ git tag -u "__Your_key_id__" -s -m "RC1 becomes v1.0 official release." rel/commons-numbers-1.0 __commit_hash__
  $ git push --tags


(22)
Switch back to the "master" branch.
We now prepare for the next round of development (here we assume that the
next version will be 1.1).

  (22a)
  Edit "doap_numbers.rdf" to add the just released version date.
  It is located at
    https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/cms-site/trunk/doap
  in the SVN repository.

  (22b)
  Retrieve changes made on the "1.0-release branch" (so that the web site will
  contain up-to-date information):

    $ git cherry-pick -n [release commit range]

  Edit "src/changes/changes.xml" to add a new section for the next release,
  setting the release date and description to "TBD".
  Then commit them.

  (22c)
  Edit every "pom.xml" file (i.e. for each module) to contain

    <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>

  This can be done using maven:

    $ mvn release:update-versions -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Prelease

  You will only be prompted for the desired version number once.
  This will miss the dist-archive/pom.xml for all the dependencies.
  These should be updated manually.
  Double-check that the "pom.xml" files *really* have a "-SNAPSHOT" suffix
  in the "<version>" property.
  Then commit them.

  (22d)
  Update the README.md files to refer the latest release. These files are
  auto-generated from the commons maven plugin using 'mvn common:readme-md'.
  The generated README.md files may have been edited for the multi-module
  set-up with extra text added to the main README.md.

  An updated will involve:

  1. Replacing the <version>1.0-beta1</version> example XML for the maven dependency to
     <version>1.0</version>.
  2. Updating any badges for Javadocs. This can be done using search and replace
     of '1.0-beta1.svg' for '1.0-beta1.svg' and '/1.0-beta1)' for '/1.0)'.

  Check the changes using 'git diff' and commit.

  (22e)
  Update the <commons.release.version> tag in the master pom for the latest release.


(23)
Allow for the web site mirrors to be updated (possibly several hours); then
send (from your apache account) a release announcement to the following ML:
  announce@apache.org
  dev@commons.apache.org
  user@commons.apache.org

If you don't have it setup already you can follow these instructions to send
email from your apache account :

https://reference.apache.org/committer/email#sendingemailfromyourapacheorgemailaddress

You can use the following message as a template:
