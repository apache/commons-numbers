     * <h2>Note</h2>
     *
     * <p>The Kahan summation uses a carry term to extend the precision of the sum.
     * This extends the 53-bit mantissa by adding more bits to hold round-off error.
     * Thus the term may effect the sum when it has a magnitude smaller than 1 ULP
     * of the current sum. The epsilon can be lowered from 2^-52 to include the
     * extra bits in the convergence criteria. The lower limit for the epsilon is
     * 2^-104. Boost uses an epsilon specified as a number of bits of accuracy. Each
     * lowering of the epsilon by a factor of 2 adds a guard digit to the sum.
     * Slower converging series will benefit from a lower epsilon. This uses 2^-62
     * to add 10 guard digits and allow testing of different thresholds when the
     * Kahan summation is used, for example in the gamma function. Lowering the
     * epsilon further is only of benefit if the terms can be computed exactly.
     * Otherwise the rounding errors of the early terms affect the final result as
     * much as the inclusion of extra guard digits.
