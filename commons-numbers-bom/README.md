Apache Commons Numbers (Bill of Materials)
===================

Bill of Materials (BOM) to aid in dependency management when referencing multiple Apache Commons Numbers artifacts.

Documentation
-------------

More information can be found on the [Apache Commons Numbers homepage](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-numbers).
Questions related to the usage of Apache Commons Numbers should be posted to the [user mailing list](https://commons.apache.org/mail-lists.html).

Getting the latest release
--------------------------
You can download source and binaries from our [download page](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-numbers/download_numbers.cgi).

Alternatively, you can pull it from the central Maven repositories and use
the Bill of Materials (BOM) for dependency management:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
      <artifactId>commons-numbers-bom</artifactId>
      <version>1.2</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Building
--------

Building requires a Java JDK and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). 
The required Java version is found in the `pom.xml` as the `maven.compiler.source` property.

From a command shell, run `mvn` without arguments to invoke the default Maven goal to run all tests and checks.

Contributing
------------

We accept Pull Requests via GitHub. The [developer mailing list](https://commons.apache.org/mail-lists.html) is the main channel of communication for contributors.
There are some guidelines which will make applying PRs easier for us:
+ No tabs! Please use spaces for indentation.
+ Respect the existing code style for each file.
+ Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports. If you feel the source code should be reformatted create a separate PR for this change.
+ Provide JUnit tests for your changes and make sure your changes don't break any existing tests by running ```mvn```.

If you plan to contribute on a regular basis, please consider filing a [contributor license agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).
You can learn more about contributing via GitHub in our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
